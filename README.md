## Overview of the Project:
The purpose of this project, using a large data set from the successful 10-year old New York City CitiBike bike sharing program, is to analyze CitiBike trip data and extract useful insights for a client who is exploring starting a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.   

All the visualizations for this project can be seen on Tableau Public:   https://public.tableau.com/views/NYCitiBikeTripAnalysis/NYCitibikeTripAnalysis?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link  

## Insights about CitiBike trips.    
<b> 1. Trip duration:</b>   
###      $\textcolor{blue}{\text{Short trips}}$  
This visualization plots unique bike trips by the length of time the bike was checked out.  We can see that customers are overwhelmingly using CitiBikes for bike trips  $\textcolor{blue}{\text {under 20 minutes}}$

This visualization plots unique bike trips by the length of time the bike was checked out $\textcolor{blue}{\text {and by gender. }}$   For all users, regardless of gender, customers are using CitiBikes for bike trips  $\textcolor{blue}{\text {under 20 minutes}}$

<b> 2. Usage by gender: </b>   
### $\textcolor{blue}{\text{More bike usage by males}}$  
In this visualization, unique bike trips are charted by the gender of the user.  Male users account for nearly $\textcolor{blue}{\text {two-thirds}}$  of all trips.

<b>   </b>  
<b>   </b> 
<b> 3. Usage trends per time of day and day of the week: </b> 
### $\textcolor{blue}{\text{Peak usage is during typical commuting hours and on weekends}}$  
This heat map visualization shows areas of concentrated bike usage by hour of day and day of week.  We can see that usage is generally heaviest during weekday morning and late afternoon hours in a pattern that correlates with typical commuter patterns, with the second heaviest concentration on weekends.   Usage on Wednesday afternoons need further exploration!

<b>   </b>  
<b>   </b> 
<b> 4. Customer type as factor in usage </b> 
### $\textcolor{blue}{\text{Subscribers rule!}}$  
This chart showing unique CitiBike trips by gender of the customer shows that over $\textcolor{blue}{\text {eighty percent}}$ of CitiBike trips are taken by subscribers versus non-subscribing customers.

This heat map showing the distribution of unique bike ride by time of day, hour of day, subscriber status and gender, graphically demonstrates that $\textcolor{blue}{\text{male subscribers}}$ are the $\textcolor{blue}{\text{heaviest users}}$ of CitiBikes and take the most trips.

#### Summary of findings and Recommendations for further analysis
* Analysis of NY CitiBike trip data shows heavy usage of the bike share program, and an expected distribution of bike usage that is heavier during typical commuting times and on the weekends.
* It also shows that the trips taken are quite short - substantially under twenty minutes.  
* Analyses of success factors for bikesharing programs show that the extent of existing bike infrastructure (bike lanes and other infrastructure), availability of transit systems for bike-to-transit links, moderate weather and moderate terrain are important factors in program success.
